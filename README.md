# Determining people's age from photo using CNN for face recognition.

## Project Description
This project is dedicated to building a model for determining the age of customers at the cash registers in a store using computer vision technology. The goal is to analyze purchases and create targeted advertising offers.

## Key Findings
Conducted exploratory data analysis of the photo dataset has revealed that the majority of the photos are of people aged between 18 and 40.  
Utilized the ResNet50 neural network architecture for training on an external GPU server.  
Achieved the target Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.35 in 6 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.
